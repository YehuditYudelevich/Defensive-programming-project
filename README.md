# 🛡️ Defensive Programming Project

This project features a **client-server architecture** designed to demonstrate key concepts of **defensive programming** and **secure communication**.

## 🔑 **Key Features**
- **User Registration and Login** – Secure user registration and login system.  
- **Key Exchange** – Secure exchange of both **asymmetric** and **symmetric** keys.  
- **Encrypted File Transmission** – Secure file transfer using encryption.  
- **Server-Side File Storage** – Files are securely stored on the server.  
- **Data Integrity Check** – Verification of data integrity using **checksums**.
